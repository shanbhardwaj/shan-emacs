  Ai workloads are fundamentally different from edge and cloud workload and more similar to high performance compute. Ai is going to increase / accelerate data center demand as technology companies offer everything from GPU-as-a-service to Models-as-a-service to completely Ai-driven applications.

The immediate hardware impact of this is data center operators will have to provision server clusters and infrastructure to support the new Ai Requirements. The primary of these being higher power density cluster to support the high performance compute nodes which in some cases can be as 100kW per rack.

Hardware needs for an Ai datacenter
  - High power density racks and cabinets with specialized cooling
  - Gpu hardware compute (they also have higher power and cooling requirements)
  - Data storage: Ai is highly data driven and applications have high storage requirements with low latency (only disadvantage from mining datacenter)
  - Low latency, non-blocking, high bandwidth networking

  These requirements will necessiatate a change in the current paradigm of the traditional data center from the design of power system to networking and compute. This is where we are well placed with our experince in mining data center yada yada ...

I'm sure everyones seen this report of size of the current Ai market at $150 billion and growing at a CAGR of 38%. This will need new compute, storage and networking. https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-market-74851580.html

Also another good question to ask if one believes in these universal values/principles is *Why is Anti-Isl a think and Anti-Plaestine not?*
