(["*scratch*" "Hi Mark,




Hey ______,

Long time! I hope all is well.

I want to check if you were looking to augument your tech team or have any software development needs. If so then I want to introduce my buddy Shan Bhardwaj, and his dev team.

His company Addval is a boutique dev firm, based in Santa Monica, that helps companies design, develop, and launch web and mobile apps.

In addition to doing a great job supporting my company, JOON, they've worked with a lot of early-stage startups and large companies like Calvin Klein, Vodafone, and Honda. I thought ___ might be a great fit and would love to see if they can help you as well!

Are you the best person to chat with?
